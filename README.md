## 3. Research Gap:

Despite the significant seismic activity potential in the region situated between the Eurasian and Indian plates, there is a notable lack of comprehensive and accurate earthquake prediction models specifically tailored to Bangladesh. Existing research has primarily focused on earthquake prediction in other regions, often overlooking the unique geological characteristics and seismic risks that Bangladesh presents. Therefore, a critical research gap exists in developing and validating machine learning-based earthquake prediction models specifically designed for Bangladesh, which could enhance preparedness and mitigation efforts in this highly vulnerable area. Addressing this gap is essential for improving the region's resilience to seismic hazards and ensuring the safety of its population and infrastructure.
